Hey there! So, I recently tried out YOLOv5 for object detection on COVID personal protective equipment such as masks, goggles, and gloves. And I must say, I was thrilled with the accuracy of the results!

YOLOv5 is an algorithm that's known for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks. By using it to detect these essential protective items, we can help ensure the safety of individuals in various settings such as hospitals, public transportation, and schools.

It's great to see the progress that computer vision technology is making in improving public health and safety. I look forward to seeing more advancements in this field!
